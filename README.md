# landing-page

This is a sample landing page I created nearly from scratch as part of The Odin Project program. The goal of the project was to use everything I learned about HTML and CSS so far to recreate an entire web page based on an image of a page layout as well as CSS font and color suggestions from The Odin Project. This project focused heavily on using CSS flexboxes to create an aesthetically pleasing layout.

I added silly text and dog pictures as placeholders because dogs never fail to make me smile.
